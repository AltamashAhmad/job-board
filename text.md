\\I'll break down the job importer system into clear phases based on the PDF requirements. Each phase will be focused and build upon the previous one.

ðŸ“‹ Phase Breakdown:

### Phase 1: Job Source API Integration
1. Create XML fetching service
   - Implement service to fetch from multiple Jobicy APIs
   - XML to JSON conversion using xml2js
   - Data normalization and validation
2. Set up cron job (1-hour interval)
   - Configure node-cron
   - Error handling and logging
   - Store raw data in MongoDB

### Phase 2: Queue System Setup
1. Redis & BullMQ Configuration
   - Set up Redis connection
   - Create job queues
   - Configure queue settings
2. Queue Producer Implementation
   - Create job producer service
   - Add jobs to queue with proper data structure
   - Handle queue errors

### Phase 3: Worker Processing System
1. BullMQ Worker Setup
   - Create worker process
   - Configure worker concurrency
   - Implement job processing logic
2. Database Operations
   - Insert new jobs
   - Update existing jobs
   - Handle failed jobs
   - Track processing metrics

### Phase 4: Import History Tracking
1. Import Logs System
   - Implement import_logs collection operations
   - Track metrics:
     - Total fetched
     - Total imported
     - New jobs count
     - Updated jobs count
     - Failed jobs with reasons
2. Status Management
   - Track import status (in_progress/completed/failed)
   - Error logging and categorization

### Phase 5: API Layer
1. Backend Routes
   - GET /api/imports (list import history)
   - GET /api/imports/:id (single import details)
   - GET /api/jobs (list imported jobs)
2. API Documentation
   - Document endpoints
   - Define request/response formats

### Phase 6: Admin UI Development
1. Dashboard Layout
   - Create responsive layout
   - Implement navigation if needed
2. Import History Table
   - Display import logs
   - Show metrics (Total/New/Updated/Failed)
   - Add sorting/filtering capabilities
3. Styling & Polish
   - Apply Tailwind CSS
   - Make UI responsive
   - Add loading states

### Phase 7: Testing & Optimization
1. System Testing
   - Test full data flow
   - Verify queue processing
   - Check error handling
2. Performance Optimization
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add proper indexes
   - Fine-tune worker concurrency

Each phase has clear deliverables and builds upon the previous phase. Would you like to start with Phase 1: Job Source API Integration? I can help you implement the XML fetching service and set up the cron job.

Let me know which phase you'd like to tackle first, and I'll guide you through the implementation step by step!
